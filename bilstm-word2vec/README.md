# Text generation using bidirectional LSTM and Doc2Vec models
Text Generation using **Bidirectional LSTM** and **Doc2Vec** models

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and data from [this article published on Medium](https://medium.com/@david.campion/text-generation-using-bidirectional-lstm-and-doc2vec-models-1-3-8979eb65cb3a).

## Content
This repo contains:
- a **data** folder, with input files
- three **notebooks**:
  - 1 generate sentence: train a bidirectional LSTM to generate sentences, word by word.
  - 2 select sentence: train a Doc2Vec model and a bidirectional LTSM to vectorize sentences
 Â - 3 generate paragraph: combine all models to generate text
